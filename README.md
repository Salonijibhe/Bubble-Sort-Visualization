# Bubble Sort Visualization (Java GUI)

A Java-based GUI application that **visually demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm** step-by-step using animated transitions. This tool is designed for educational purposes to help students and developers understand how Bubble Sort works internally.

## ‚ú® Features

- Real-time visualization of each sorting pass
- Color-coded highlights for:
  - Elements being compared (`Black`)
  - Swapped elements (`Red`)
  - Sorted elements (`Green`)
- Interactive input via text field
- Clean, intuitive layout using Java Swing and AWT
- Displays progress with pass count and sorting animation
